# Grid Creator
This project is a part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It's a simple grid creator that allows you to create a grid of squares. You can specify the number of squares per side, and each square will be assigned a random background color when you mouse over it.


## How to Use

1. Open the project in your browser.
2. Click the button to start creating squares. You will be prompted to enter the number of squares per side.
3. Enter a number less than or equal to 100.
4. Move your mouse over the squares to assign them random background colors.


## Future Improvements

- Add the ability to specify the range of random colors.
- Add the ability to reset the grid without refreshing the page.
